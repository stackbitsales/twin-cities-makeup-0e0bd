          Do the makeup and hair rates for the bride include a consultation
          before the wedding day? What does the consultation include?

            text: >
              The consultation fee is built into the bride’s makeup and hair
              rate.   A consultation before the wedding day is highly
              recommended so that you are assured that you will have the exact
              look you want for your big day.  A full makeup application
              including airbrush makeup with false lashes will be applied for
              the makeup portion of the consult. Your requested hair style or
              updo will also be completed at the consult. The stylist will do
              minor adjustments to the hair style; if need be at that time. The
              consultations takes about 1 hour. If more than one look is
              requested, additional fees may apply. If a client is late to a
              consultation that may also hinder the styling options available at
              the consultation.

              amount is $80 (per requested service) and then full service rates
              would be charged on the wedding day.
