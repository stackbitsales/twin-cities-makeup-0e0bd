      - question: >-
          Do the makeup and hair rates for the bride include a consultation
          before the wedding day? What does the consultation include?
        answer: >-
          The consultation fee is built into the bride’s makeup and hair rate.  
          A consultation before the wedding day is highly recommended so that
          you are assured that you will have the exact look you want for your
          big day.  A full makeup application including airbrush makeup with
          false lashes will be applied for the makeup portion of the consult.
          Your requested hair style or updo will also be completed at the
          consult. The stylist will do minor adjustments to the hair style; if
          need be at that time. The consultations takes about 1 hour. If more
          than one look is requested, additional fees may apply. If a client is
          late to a consultation that may also hinder the styling options
          available at the consultation.
      - question: What should you bring to the consultation?
        answer: >-
          Bring along any hair pictures of styles you want to try and the hair
          accessories that you plan on wearing (ex: headpiece, flower, combs,
          fascinators) and makeup pictures that inspire the look you want.
          Please do not bring your veil.  You should come without makeup on, and
          have clean hair. Bring friends and family along, if you prefer!
      - question: Are consultations for the bridal party too?
        answer: >-
          Consultations are NOT included in the rates for the bridal party. If
          they request a in-studio consult before the wedding day; that amount
          is $80 (per requested service) and then full service rates would be
          charged on the wedding day.
      - question: When should the consultation be booked? How far in advance?
        answer: >-
          The consultations are done about 5-6 weeks prior to the wedding day
          and are held at Lisa’s studio. Consultations are done Monday-Friday
          during the days/evenings.  Saturday is the busiest day for weddings
          and therefore we do not book consultations at any time on Saturdays.
          The studio is closed all day Sundays.
      - question: What is the deposit for?
        answer: >-
          Non-refundable deposit is due upon booking. This will go toward your final balance for services. The deposit assures your date is reserved by Lisa or a member of her team. Whichever stylist/makeup artist does the bridal consultation will also be the stylist/makeup artist who will be doing the brides wedding day services.
