Lisa and her two senior hair stylists Melanie and Trish met the bride, Ana, at the [St. Paul Hotel](https://www.saintpaulhotel.com/) to get her and the entire bridal party PLUS the two moms ready for the BIG DAY. Everyone was so relaxed and chill the entire time it seemed they almost forgot they were getting ready for a wedding!

Lisa, Melanie, and the bride had the [wedding day consultation](https://www.twincitiesmakeup.com/bridal-makeup-and-hair-styling/) only five days prior to the wedding day because she was an out of town bride. No worries though because she was thrilled with the results and excited to see us that weekend for her wedding day.

Ana requested a very natural look for her complexion with focus on brightening her eyes. Lisa did a soften black winged eyeliner with [Velour Mink Luxury False Lashes](https://www.velourlashes.com/). *She is obsessed with the Velour Whispie Sweet Nothings lash, so GLAM!* They applied a light coverage airbrush foundation from [Temptu](https://temptu.com/). The bride requested a pink lip color so Lisa used her favorite rich lip [Bobbi Brown shade in “Uber Pink”](http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/14360/22750/makeup/lips/lips-best-sellers/rich-lip-color/fh12) a medium neutral pink and. The bride wanted to enhance her brows for photos so Lisa used [Makeup Forever Professional Pro Brow Sculpting Pen in Brown](http://www.makeupforever.com/us/en-us/make-up/eyes/eyebrows/pro-sculpting-brow?sku=7494).

Since Ana’s dress was elaborate she wanted more of a [classic bridal hair style](https://www.twincitiesmakeup.com/photos/bridal-makeup-hair-artistry-photos/) to compliment the dress and the overall elegance of her wedding. Senior hair stylist Melanie styled a standard low chignon and added overlapping twist pulled from both sides, incorporating the twist into the back of the hair style. Some of the bridal party requested braids combined into a loose updo and most wanted a effortless low updo with textured curls.

These girls looked gorgeous and looked like they had a blast at this wedding. Congrats Ana and Eric!
