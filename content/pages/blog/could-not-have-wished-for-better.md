"I am beyond pleased with the work of Lisa Reinhardt and her team. She is not only talented but extremely knowledgeable about the products she uses and what will work best for your skin and the look you are going for. As part of the bridal package you have the opportunity for a full trial run through/consultation so you can feel confident that your vision is understood and your look can and will be recreated on the big day!
After deciding what feature I wanted to focus on (my eyes) I chose to use Lisa for that extra service that made all the difference and totally gave me that “bridal” experience… eyelash extensions!! They are incredible and truly made me feel SO glamorous. Whats more, they lasted extremely well (10.21 to 12.4) when I visited for a fill (I wanted to enjoy having them for the holidays) I’m pretty much obsessed now.
Thank you again Lisa and Team for making me and my bridal party feel so beautiful and relaxed on such a special day!"
