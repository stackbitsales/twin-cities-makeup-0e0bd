  Lisa and her staff were fabulous. They came to my Mom’s house in the morning
  and did all our hair and makeup onsite which was so fun. I know I had a lot of
  questions and changes and they were patient and accommodating. Everyone in our
  bridal party and my Mom and my husband’s Mom looked so beautiful. Hair and
  makeup lasted until the end of the night and looked flawless. I felt confident
  and beautiful on my wedding day. A+"
