  "Lisa and her team did an amazing job on my hair and makeup for my big day! I
  booked Lisa and her team after reading so many good reviews about them and
  they definitely live up to their expectations. I was able to tell them what I
  wanted to be done and they did exactly that. It was so nice and convenient
  that Lisa and her team were able to travel to the hotel that way we didn’t
  feel rushed at all. My makeup and hair was everything I could have asked for.
  All my friends were so stunned on how amazing my hair and makeup turned out. I
  wish I could replay the look on my husbands face when he saw me for the first
  time.I felt so beautiful and confident for my big day!! I would definitely
  recommend booking with Lisa and her team."
