  "Lisa and her team (Melanie and Poonoy) did an excellent job with on-site hair
  and makeup services for myself and my wedding party. I can honestly say that
  her airbrush bridal makeup was nothing short of amazing! Lisa is
  extraordinarily talented!


  Because I lived out of state, Lisa and Poonoy were able to do my trial run two
  months before my wedding, which was ahead of schedule. I appreciated her
  accommodating that.


  It was also a huge help to have Lisa, Poonoy, and Melanie come to me instead
  of me going to a salon. I would highly recommend on site services, and I would
  highly recommend Lisa’s makeup artistry!"
