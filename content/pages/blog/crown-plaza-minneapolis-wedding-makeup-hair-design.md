  This past summer my team and I were lucky to work with several amazing bridal
  parties for Minneapolis weddings. One particular bride, Melissa, was such a
  laid back bride that was so pleasant to work with, not to mention a beautiful
  bride! :)

This past summer my team and I were lucky to work with several amazing bridal parties for Minneapolis weddings. One particular bride, Melissa, was such a laid back bride that was so pleasant to work with, not to mention a beautiful bride! :)

A week before the big day we applied [eyelash extensions](https://www.twincitiesmakeup.com/eyelash-extensions/) onto the bride. Then on the wedding day, we added an extra half strip of false eyelashes to give her eyes that extra “pop.”

The [Lisa Reinhardt Makeup & Hair Team](https://www.twincitiesmakeup.com/photos/on-location-team-photos/) traveled to the Crown Plaza in Minneapolis to style the bride and her bridal party. There were ten ladies that received [makeup and hair styling services](https://www.twincitiesmakeup.com/bridal-makeup-and-hair-styling/).

Melissa was one of the most laid-back brides, she was actually cross-stitching while getting her hair styled! A great idea to relax before the events. The mother-of-the-bride was also very pleasant and calming to be around. We feel blessed to work with such great clientele.
