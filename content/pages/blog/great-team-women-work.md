title: They Were A Great Team Of Women To Work With!

excerpt: >-
  "I hired Lisa’s amazing team for my October 18, 2014 wedding. They were
  amazing to work with! I live in New York and was planning my wedding in
  Minnesota, so this was a little challenging, but they were very flexible when
  planning my trial hair and makeup run. On the day of the wedding they showed
  up bright and early and I hired them to do my hair and makeup, three
  bridesmaids and both mothers-it was big job, but they did wonderful! My makeup
  held up throughout the day and my hair looked amazing, she weaved a ribbon
  through it that looked so beautiful, only bummer was some of it fell out right
  after the ceremony and you could see it dangling in the pictures late on. It
  would have been nice to have two hair stylists there for the number of women
  that needed their hair done-because it got a little hectic, but they handled
  it like a professional, and when one of my bridesmaids did not like her
  hairstyle, she quickly redid it and it looked amazing. I truly felt beautiful
  on my day and the women all looked amazing!! They were a great team of women
  to work with!"
