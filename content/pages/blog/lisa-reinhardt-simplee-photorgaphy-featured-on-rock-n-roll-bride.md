Kelsea Fehlen photographer and owner of Simplee Photography amazes me every time we work together with her creativity and unique ways she finds her inspiration. LOVE love her work! [www.simpleephotography.com](http://www.simpleephotography.com/). Fine art wedding and lifestyle portraiture, servicing areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

We worked a Bridal Styling Photoshoot with Kelsea. We decided that a natural complexion with light airbrush makeup, bold eyes, delicate lips and simple hair pinning would be best for the outdoor location. It turned out gorgeous! The location was Hidden Falls Regional Park in St. Paul, MN.  A secret gem :) Kelsea submitted the photos to [Rock and Roll Bride.Com](http://www.rocknrollbride.com/2012/11/twisty-tree-roots-on-the-banks-of-a-river/) and they decided to feature it last month on their website! Project was called, [“Twisty Tree Roots on the bank of a River”](http://www.rocknrollbride.com/2012/11/twisty-tree-roots-on-the-banks-of-a-river/). Yay! Very excited to be part of this cool project! Follow this [link](http://www.rocknrollbride.com/2012/11/twisty-tree-roots-on-the-banks-of-a-river/) and check it out! I must mention, the model Rebekah Ford is a insanely beautiful women! I could not stop staring at her…stunning!

These photos are currently also the featured blog for March on <http://www.loveandlavender.com/>. The vintage lace dress, the masks, and the overall feeling from this styled session sent chills (the good kind) down our backs. We can’t get enough of this river bank shoot….is what they are saying on the Love and Lavender website. Go check it out!
