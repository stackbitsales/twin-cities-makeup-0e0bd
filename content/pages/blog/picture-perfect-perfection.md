"Lisa and her work is nothing less than perfection! Before my big day I began seeing Lisa for NovaLash applications – during these appointments we bonded over girl talk, something every bride needs before the big day! I always left her office feeling relaxed and happy – she just has one of those fabulous personalities! This combined with her true talent; I knew I had to hire her for my wedding! Lisa did not disappoint! The morning of the wedding was perfect, no chaos or stress, complete bliss which I am shocked to report with a bridal party of 10+! Lisa is a true professional and I cannot thank her enough for making my day truly special and most importantly, making myself and girls look BEAUTIFUL! Lisa you are on the top of my recommendation list – thank you again for everything!"
