Whether the desired hair style is classic or modern, glamorous or romantic, we will incorporate your ideas to create your own personalized look with our Minneapolis and St.Paul based wedding hair styling services.

Every hair stylist on our team is experienced and talented in all ethnicity/textures/types. Each of our hair stylists are professionally trained and certified.

*For Brides*: At your hair consultation show us your bridal hair Pinterest board (we know you have one!!) and bring along any headpiece or hair accessory you plan on wearing for the wedding day. Your stylist will let you know at this time if you need to add hair length, improve the hairs condition with conditioning treatments, or may suggest a color change or trim.

**We often suggest clip in hair extensions.** This gives you the appearance of longer thicker, fuller hair without the high expense and possible hair breakage of typical bonded hair extensions. Clip-In Extensions add extra volume without the commitment of fused or panel hair extensions. Hair can be curled, cut/colored, flat-ironed, styled into an up-do, half up or left all down . The possibilities are endless and hair can easily be removed after when day is over! *\*\*additional fees do apply for the placement of clip-in extensions*

*Keep in mind that over 75% of the bridal hair photos from Pinterest that we see, already have the clip-in hair extensions to achieve the admired style.*
