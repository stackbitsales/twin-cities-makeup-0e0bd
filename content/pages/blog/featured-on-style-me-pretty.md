This was a styled photo session with some incredible local vendors. The photographer [Jody Savage](http://www.jodysavagephotography.com/young-love-minnesota-wedding-photographer-published-in-style-me-pretty/) used her to creative talents to recreate a photo session that captures “Young Love” perfectly and sweetly all at the same time. I just love the colors and flowers throughout the shoot and all of the little details that added such a special touch to the images.
