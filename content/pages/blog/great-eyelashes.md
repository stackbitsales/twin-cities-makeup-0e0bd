I found Lisa by looking online at reviews, and I am so glad I did because she was as great as everyone says! I loved my wedding makeup and hair!! I also got eyelash extensions from her the week of, and they were the best thing I could have done, they looked fabulous on my honeymoon in st lucia and saved me tons of time by not having to wear much makeup there.

Lisa and her crew took care of myself, my 9 bridesmaids, my personal attendant and my mom. We all did airbrush makeup and it looked flawless all night. We did photos before our wedding ceremony so I was nervous about how my hair and makeup would look by the dance, but it was still flawless. A consultation was also included in my package to make sure I had the exact look I wanted for my big day. On top of it all Lisa is such a sweetheart. I would refer her any day!
