I get lots of questions about the brand of products I use on my  eyelash extension clients. There are tons of lash extension competitors out there and, believe me, I did plenty of research before I invested in training to become a certified Lash Extensionist; which was over 3 years ago now! I decided that [Novalash](http://www.novalash.com/) was the only way to go based on their **client reviews and product ingredients**. I only use Novalash brand adhesive (Platinum Bond). It is medical grade, physician-formulated and does not contain formaldehyde. Novalash brand eyelash extensions are synthetic and come in a **variety of sizes, texture and colors**.

There are lots of different price ranges for Eyelash Extensions nowadays.  If you are making your decision based solely on the $$$ factor please **make sure your Lash Extensionist is truly certified**.  Eyelash Extensions is an unregulated service; anyone can claim to, “do eyelash extensions” and you would never know until the end result. It is Ok to ask to see their certificate and products before the application begins. Taking these small steps will ensure that you are getting a **safe lash application** and also receiving a service from a quality Lash Extensionist. I have seen many women come to me with requests to fix a set of lashes that were done by a “professional”. Because I want every woman in Minnesota to have the pleasure of a\*\* full, beautiful, set of lashes\*\* I run frequent specials for new customers…. so make your experience the best it can be and [book with me today](/contact)! Once applied, these eyelash extensions are so natural looking it is often extremely difficult to tell even up close that you have extensions on. You wake up every morning with fabulous lashes!
