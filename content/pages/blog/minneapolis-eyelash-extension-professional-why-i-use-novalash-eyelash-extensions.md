I get lots of questions about the brand of products I use on my  eyelash extension clients. There are tons of lash extension competitors out there and, believe me, I did plenty of research before I invested in training to become a certified Lash Extensionist; which was over 3 years ago now! I decided that [Novalash](http://www.novalash.com/) was the only way to go based on their **client reviews and product ingredients**. I only use Novalash brand adhesive (Platinum Bond). It is medical grade, physician-formulated and does not contain formaldehyde. Novalash brand eyelash extensions are synthetic and come in a **variety of sizes, texture and colors**.
